## Title (50 characters max)

CryptoPrice - Live Crypto Tracker

## Description (4000 characters max)

A simple widget to check crypto prices on your Garmin watch. Shows real-time prices and 24-hour changes pulled from the Binance public API.

WHAT IT DOES

Displays your chosen cryptocurrencies with current price and daily percentage change. Green means up, red means down. You can add or remove coins through the menu, and prices update automatically in the background.

The glance view shows your first coin so you can check the price without opening the app.

DEFAULT COINS

BTC, ETH, BNB, TRX, SOL, POL

You can customize this list to whatever you want.

LIMITATIONS

Only cryptocurrencies available on Binance with a USDT trading pair are supported. Most major coins work (BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA, XRP, DOGE, etc.), but some smaller or region-specific tokens might not be available.

WHY I MADE THIS

I built this as a side project because I was curious about how Garmin watches work. Wanted to learn something new and ended up with an app that I actually use daily. Hopefully you find it useful too.
